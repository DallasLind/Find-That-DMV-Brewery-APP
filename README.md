# find-that-dmv-brewery-app

### Heroku API + Front-End
A mix of my api from [this repo](https://github.com/DallasLind/DMV-Breweries-API) and React, I attempted to create a front-end to allow users to access the information in a user-friendly fashion. 

### Technologies
* Node.js
* React
* Heroku
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Bootstrap 

### Future Plans
Implement CRUD functionality to the page. I'd like to allow users to create, update, and delete entries in the database along with an ability to search for specific breweries.
